# Constitution Update Workflow

Given the current project context and requirements, do this:

1. Study the comprehensive guide of Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
   to understand the methodology:
   - Review the core principles and practices of SDD from
     <https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md#specification-driven-development-sdd>
   - Understand the relationship between specifications, implementation,
     and testing
   - Analyze how SDD fits into the overall development lifecycle

2. Analyze the current project context in memory to understand:
   - Project architecture and technology stack
   - Existing development practices and workflows
   - Current pain points and improvement opportunities
   - Team structure and collaboration patterns

3. Read the existing constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand:
   - Current constitutional principles and governance
   - Areas that need improvement or customization
   - Template references and dependencies
   - Version history and amendment process

4. Develop a customized constitution that fits the project like a glove:
   - Define core principles specific to the project's domain and requirements
   - Establish clear development workflows and quality gates
   - Set appropriate standards for testing, documentation, and code quality
   - Create governance rules for constitution maintenance and amendments

5. Execute the constitution update checklist from `.specify/memory/constitution_update_checklist.md`:
   - Update all templates referenced in the checklist
   - Modify command documentation to reflect new principles
   - Ensure cross-references between documents are consistent
   - Verify all examples and code samples align with new rules

6. Validate the constitution and template updates:
   - Check that all templates reference new requirements correctly
   - Verify examples are updated to match new constitutional rules
   - Ensure no contradictions exist between documents
   - Run through a sample implementation plan to verify compliance

7. Update version tracking and documentation:
   - Increment constitution version number following semantic versioning
   - Note version updates in template footers
   - Add amendment details to constitution history
   - Update last sync check date and alignment status

8. Report completion status with:
   - Constitution version and ratification details
   - List of all updated templates and documents
   - Validation results and any issues found
   - Next steps for team adoption and training
