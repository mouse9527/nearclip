# Story M6: Text Transfer via BLE

## Description
As a user, when devices are in BLE proximity, I want to synchronize captured text to paired devices.

## Priority
P0

## Acceptance Criteria
- Paired device A copying "Test" results in device B receiving it within 1 second
- BLE connection is stable and reliable
- Handle multiple text transfers efficiently
- Maintain connection security for paired devices
- Provide feedback on transfer status

## Implementation Notes
- Implement BLE GATT characteristics for data transfer
- Use efficient data chunking for large text content
- Implement connection management and reconnection logic
- Handle BLE range limitations and interference
- Optimize for power efficiency on mobile devices

## Dependencies
- M1: Device unique ID generation
- M2: First device pairing
- M3: Paired device list
- M4: Capture local text copy events
- M5: Text message structure definition
- Platform-specific BLE APIs

## Testing Requirements
- Test BLE discovery and connection
- Verify text transfer timing (1-second target)
- Test connection stability and reconnection
- Validate security measures
- Performance and power consumption testing

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ transfer success rate
- < 1 second transfer latency (80% of cases)
- < 5% battery impact during active use
- 100% secure connection establishment
