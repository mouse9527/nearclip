# Story M1: Generate Device Unique ID

## Description
As a device, I need to generate a unique ID and key pair on first startup for subsequent pairing.

## Priority
P0

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each device has a unique ID
- ID remains consistent after restart
- Key pair generation follows security best practices
- Device ID format is consistent across platforms

## Implementation Notes
- Use platform-specific secure storage for persistence
- Generate cryptographic key pair for device authentication
- Consider UUID v4 or similar format for device ID
- Implement secure key storage mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Security framework
- Platform-specific secure storage

## Testing Requirements
- Verify ID generation on first startup
- Test ID persistence after device restart
- Validate key pair generation
- Cross-platform ID format consistency

## Success Metrics
- 100% unique ID generation rate
- 100% ID persistence after restart
- Secure key storage implementation
