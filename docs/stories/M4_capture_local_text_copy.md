# Story M4: Capture Local Text Copy Events

## Description
As a user, when I copy text, the application should capture the content and prepare it for synchronization.

## Priority
P0

## Acceptance Criteria
- Copying "Hello" triggers capture event in application logs
- Application captures only text content (not files/images)
- Capture process is efficient and doesn't impact system performance
- Handle large text content appropriately
- Respect user privacy settings for clipboard monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use platform-specific clipboard monitoring APIs
- Implement efficient content change detection
- Add debounce mechanism to avoid excessive captures
- Handle different text formats and encodings
- Provide user control over clipboard monitoring

## Dependencies
- Platform-specific clipboard APIs
- Event handling framework
- User preferences system

## Testing Requirements
- Test text capture on various content types
- Verify performance impact measurement
- Test debounce mechanism effectiveness
- Validate privacy controls
- Large content handling

## Success Metrics
- 100% text capture accuracy
- < 100ms capture latency
- < 1% system performance impact
- Privacy controls 100% functional
