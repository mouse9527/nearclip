# Story M2: First Device Pairing (PIN/QR Verification)

## Description
As a user, I want to confirm pairing through PIN/QR code before transferring data between two devices to ensure only trusted devices can connect.

## Priority
P0

## Acceptance Criteria
- Connection only established with correct PIN/QR scan
- Connection rejected on invalid PIN/QR
- PIN generation follows secure random patterns
- QR code contains secure pairing information
- Pairing process is user-friendly and clear

## Implementation Notes
- Implement secure PIN generation (6-8 digits)
- QR code should contain encrypted pairing data
- Use cryptographic challenge-response for verification
- Implement timeout for pairing attempts
- Provide clear user feedback during pairing process

## Dependencies
- M1: Device unique ID generation
- Security framework
- Cryptographic libraries

## Testing Requirements
- Test PIN generation and validation
- Verify QR code scanning and validation
- Test pairing timeout and retry logic
- Validate cryptographic challenge-response
- User experience testing

## Success Metrics
- 100% pairing security
- < 2 second pairing time
- < 1% false positive/negative rate
- User satisfaction > 4.0/5.0
